# apre-method

This app calculates the user's 1/3/6/10 rep maxes to utilize their preferred protocol for the APRE strength training method. It then takes data from their third working set, and tells the user how to adjust accordingly for their fourth working set.

*It's deployed [here](https://github.com/dianestephani/apre-method).*
